# Q-economics

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive, responsive, and user-friendly online portal for students to access mock tests and previous year tests. The portal will feature Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and detailed answer questions, providing an interactive platform for users to take tests, receive instant feedback, and track their progress over time.

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend

- Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the structure and interactive features.
- Implement a modern frontend framework/library like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js.
- Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

### Backend

- Choose a robust backend framework:
  - Option 1: Node.js with Express.js.
  - Option 2: Python with Django or Flask.
  - Option 3: PHP with Laravel.
- Develop RESTful APIs for client-server communication.

### Database

- Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data.
- Implement an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interactions (e.g., Sequelize for Node.js, SQLAlchemy for Python).

### Authentication and Security

- Implement secure authentication mechanisms (JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0 for social logins).
- Encrypt sensitive data and use secure protocols (HTTPS).
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests for frontend and backend components.
